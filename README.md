## Overview

Smaller food organizations, often overshadowed by large food banks, find it difficult to spread information and gather volunteers. Inspired by the obscurity of smaller-scale food organizations, Caring Cranes has decided to build Hidden Hunger to aid users in finding a food organization near their personal location. With this Hidden Hunger app, users can submit their location and a directory of registered food organizations with their respective distances will appear. Users can choose from a list of organizations to get in-depth information for each food organization. For those looking for a meal or a place to volunteer, Hidden Hunger has a large directory for smaller food organizations around their location.

Currently, Hidden Hunger only has a working directory in the immediate Tri-State Area. We are continuing to expand our ever-growing database with registered food organizations.
